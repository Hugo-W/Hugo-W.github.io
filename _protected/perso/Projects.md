## Log

### 30/11/20

Continued the RNNLM. IMplemented some utilites for text cleaning and preprocessing that can be more widely used across my different projects.

### 24/11/2020

Continued implementation of [RNNLM](https://github.com/Hugo-W/NNLM/pyLM) (yes back to basics...), in view to integrate the VAE on sentences.

Also continued quite a lot on the phase dependent TRF project.

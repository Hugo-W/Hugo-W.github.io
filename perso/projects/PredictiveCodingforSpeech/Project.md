title: "Predictive Coding for Speech comprehension"

This project is a long running one where I look for evidence or counter-evidence for predictive coding mechanisms during speech comprehension. The made idea is that higher level of representations are
leveraging _updates_ by predicting neural activity representing lower levels. This should happen between every level of the hierarchy. As an example, if a word is strongly expected/predicted but another word, more suprising, occurs, then this should elicit a strong prediction error that will be passed up the hierarchy (from acoustic to word-level representations).

The project will look at every possible testable hypothesis on measured EEG or MEG activity as well as putative computational models implementing such mechanisms.

## Testing The theory using MEEG

### Relationship between reconstruction accuracy of acoustic features and linguistic features

The first goal is to see how a time resolved accuracy of reconstruction of the acoustic envelope from meeg signals vary with linguistic features.

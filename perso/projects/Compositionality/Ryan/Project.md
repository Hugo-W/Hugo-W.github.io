# Starting points
- Meanings must be constructed in the mind and brain (Baggio 2018)
- Formal semantics taught us about how meaning might be composed (Frege, Dowty, Partee, Heim, Kratzer, a.o.) in a (strictly) bottom-up manner
- Computer science taught us about how meanings might be represented (e.g. Glove models) and how meanings might be composed (Mitchel & Lapata 2008)
- Meaning representations are shifted and modulated by context (Kutas & Federmeier 2011; Nieuwland & Van Berkum 2006)
- Naturalistic stimuli are important for language research (Hasson and many others)

# Neural representation of composed items
Constructing complex meanings requires the language system to combine smaller pieces into larger structures. One approach to the brain bases of meaning composition is to study how the meanings of two words in a phrase (such as red boat) combine (e.g. Pylkk채nen, 2019; Bozic et al., 2015; Zaccarella & Friederici, 2015). These research programs have made contributions that are foundational to our understanding of the neurobiology of composition. For example, the presence of conceptual combination, or the conceptual aspects of meaning composition, drives left anterior temporal lobe activity at around 200-250ms post stimulus onset (e.g. Pylkk채nen, 2019). These correlates were obtained during the processing of tightly controlled stimuli as participants performed a task, such as picture-naming. Here, we deploy naturalistic stimuli to investigate the nature of the neural representation of composed linguistic material embedded in a naturalistic context, such as during story listening.

We plan to use a decoding approach to probe representations of the second item in phrasal pairs of the following: adjective-noun, adverb-verb, adverb-adjective, verb-noun , (and even noun-noun in cases of compounding.) We can ask a number of questions: (1) To probe a more general representation of composed phrases, regardless of phrase types: can we decode the first item in the pair from the second item? (2) To probe whether adjectival modification is different from predication: can we decode whether the first item is an adjective or a verb, when the second item is a noun? (3) To probe whether fine-grained information about modification: can we decode adverb types (e.g. Kim & Pylkk채nen, 2019) from the verb in adverb-verb pairs, or can we decode adjective types (e.g. Ziegler & Pylkk채nen) from the noun in adjective-noun pairs?

- Another angle is to the temporal generalisation method  (King & Dehaene, 2014; also e.g. Fyshe, Sudre, Wehbe, Rafidi, & Mitchell, 2019)?
- Can we use (compressed) word embeddings to represent lexical semantics?
